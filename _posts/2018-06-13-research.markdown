  <details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">Over the past few decades, Indian women have become more educated and have gained greater control over their fertility decisions, but, unlike the western experience, this has not led to increased participation in the labor market. I examine the role played by the male breadwinner norm in explaining this puzzle. I first establish a sharp discontinuity in the distribution of the share of the wife’s income in the total household income where the wife’s income exceeds the husband’s income. The size of this discontinuity is much larger than that observed in developed countries like the U.S. I show that this pattern can be best explained by gender identity norms that make couples averse to situations where the wife earns more than her husband. I do so by interpreting the male breadwinner norm as a notch in household preferences which results in this kind of aversion. Moreover, I show that this aversion has real implications on the labor market decisions of the wife. First, she is less likely to participate in market activities if her potential income is likely to exceed her husband’s. Second, she earns less than her potential if she does work and can potentially out-earn her husband. I observe that this phenomenon is more pronounced in couples where husbands are making the labor market decisions of their wives and in households that follow other regressive gender norms suggesting backlash.</font></p></details></ul>

<ul style="margin-top:-17px;">
<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">Evidence across developing countries suggests that parents are often credit constrained when making schooling decisions for their children. But little is known about the severity of this constraint. That is, would temporary shocks to liquidity affect parents’ decisions? To identify this effect, we use a shock to available cash in the economy induced by India’s 2016 demonetization. The policy made 86\% of currency-in-circulation illegal overnight and individuals could deposit old notes at the bank in exchange for new ones. We identify the impacts of demonetization’s severity by leveraging discontinuities in banking access across Indian districts. Difference-in-discontinuity estimates show that districts which experienced a more severe liquidity shock saw an increase in dropout from private schools but no effect in free public schools, consistent with the presence of real credit constraints.</font></p></details></ul>
