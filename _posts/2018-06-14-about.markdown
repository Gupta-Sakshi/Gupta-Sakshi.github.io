I am a 5th year PhD Candidate in the Department of Economics at Columbia University. My primary research interests are in the fields of Labor Economics, Development Economics and Gender.

My current work focuses on understanding the impact of social and cultural norms on economic outcomes for women, especially their labor force participation in India.

I hold a Master's degree in Economics from the Delhi School of Economics and a Bachelor’s degree from St. Stephen’s College.
