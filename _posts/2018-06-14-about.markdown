I am a 5th year PhD Candidate in the Department of Economics at Columbia University. My primary research interests are in the fields of Urban Economics, Applied Micro and Industrial Organization.

Before joining Columbia, I completed my Masters from Delhi School of Economics in 2015.

Apart from research, I like playing chess and squash.
