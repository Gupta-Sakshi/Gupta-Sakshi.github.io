I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Economics at Columbia University. I am currently on the job market and expect to graduate in May 2023. 

My primary research interests are in the fields of Development Economics, Labor Economics and Applied Microeconomics, with a specific focus on Gender. My current work focuses on understanding the impact of social and cultural norms on economic outcomes for women, especially their labor market outcomes in India. 
 
I hold a Master's degree in Economics from the Delhi School of Economics and a Bachelor’s degree from St. Stephen’s College.
